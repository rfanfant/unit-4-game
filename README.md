Crystal Collector Game


                                            About Crystal Collector

This game was developed as part of my course work(assignment) as a way for me to learn about JQuery. The assignment was to develop a game called Crystal 
collector. 

The game objective is for the player to match a randomly generated target number whose value ranges from 19 to 120. There 4 crystals displayed to the player,
though the crystal values are hidden from the player. The crystal values are randomly generated with values ranging between 1 to 12. When the player clicks/selects any of the 4 crystals, the hidden crystal values are added to the players total score. The players total score is then displayed. 

The player wins if their total score matches/equals the target number. The player losses if their total scrore exceeds the target number. As player continues playing if their total score is less than the target number. The game messages the user if they win or lose, and the game begins again. This time the crystal 
and target values are reset to newly created random numbers. The app keeps track of the players wins and losses. 

Here is a demo of a simliar game developed by another developer. 1. [Watch the demo](https://youtu.be/yNI0l2FMeCk).



                                             Game Objectives
I learned the following about using JQuery while writing Crystal Collector

 JS Basics
  * Arrays
  * Logging to the console - - removed almost all of the debug code in the final release
  * Alerts, prompts, confirms - removed almost all of the debug code in the final release
  * Array functions

* For Loops
  * Manipulating array data with loop

* Browser Events
  * Events
  * document.onkeyup
  * document.getElementById
  * Trigger functions on browser events

* Functions
  * Function definition
  * Function argumentss
  * Calling functions

* Objects
  * Understanding “this”
  * Callbacks

* jQuery
  * Query the DOM using jQuery
  * Listening for and responding to user events using jQuery



                                         NOTES

Normally I would place all my javascript files into a seperate file. This applicaiton program was so short/compact that I placed all the code into the 
html file. The reason is that I believe it would be difficult for others to understand how the code functions spliting up such a small application into
mulitple files.
